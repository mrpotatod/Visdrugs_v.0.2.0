# VisDrugs: An Interactive Shiny R Package for Drug Safety Analysis
**Use online**: [VisDrugs Web App](http://sctdb.cn/shiny-server/Visdrugs_v.0.2.0/)  
**Or run locally** as follows:  

## Overview  
This shinyR app integrates **adverse reaction data** in ASCII format from the **FAERS** database, covering **2014Q3 to 2024Q3**. The dataset specifically filters reports submitted by four types of healthcare professionals:  
- **HP** (Health Professional)  
- **MD** (Physician)  
- **OT** (Other Health Professional)  
- **PH** (Pharmacist)  

### **Dataset Highlights**
- **Over 2,700,000** independent reports from FAERS, each involving only **one drug**, avoiding adverse reaction interference from multiple drugs.  
- Covers **~4,000 drug active ingredients** and provides **6,000,000+ adverse reaction entries**.  
- Enables precise drug safety analysis with an interactive interface.  

Users can **enter the active ingredient of a drug** to analyze and compare potential adverse reactions.

## **Understanding Adverse Reactions in FAERS**
The adverse reactions referenced in this tool correspond to the **Preferred Term (PT)** in the FAERS database, based on the **Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)**.  
When reporting data to FAERS, professionals may include:  
‚úî **Adverse reactions caused by diseases**  
‚úî **Reactions related to the drug's indications**  
‚úî **Reactions directly caused by the drug itself**  

For **accurate analysis of drug-induced adverse reactions**, special care should be taken to **exclude indications-related adverse reactions**.  

### **How to Ensure Accuracy**
1. If the **top 15 adverse reactions** in a drug‚Äôs pie chart are all **related to indications**, download the raw data.  
2. Identify the most **frequent adverse reactions unrelated to indications**.  
3. Use the **"Reaction Comparison Between Drugs"** mode for in-depth analysis.
